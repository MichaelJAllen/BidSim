/** Simple bid simulation command line app.
  *
  * A group of bidders make random bids in a ''bid round'', according to a probability array (relating the probability
  * of bidding the index value of that probability). The winner is the bidder with the lowest unique bid; if two or more
  * bidders make the same bid, then they cannot win; if all bidders make the same bid, then no-one wins.
  *
  * This simulation was created as part of the solution to
  * [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43968718/creating-a-simulation-of-a-bidding-game-on-geogebra this question on
  * _StackOverflow_]].
  *
  * The easiest way to run the simulation is via _sbt_ using the command: `sbt "run 1000"`.
  *
  * The above example will perform 1,000 bid rounds.
